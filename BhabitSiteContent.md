## About BHABIT

BHABIT is a decentralized chaos economy — a cultural force disguised as a crypto token. Built for the underbanked and the overbrave, it rewards raw impulse, rebellion, and the creative anarchy of youth. It’s not a meme. It’s a movement. From Mexico City to the world, BHABIT gives people a way to burn their path into the future.

With integrations like Flexa for instant stablecoin transactions and Anvil for lending, BHABIT becomes more than speculative. It becomes usable. Spend, stake, vote, or burn — just don’t sit still.

## The Born Vault

Inspired by myths, bets, and chaos.
The Born Vault is a ritual. A high-risk, high-reward burn event where participants destroy BBIT for a shot at unlocking a massive communal vault.

- Mythic lore meets token game theory
